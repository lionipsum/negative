# Vanilla Starter

The goal here is to have a vanilla project starter that provides webpack and the bundler and includes typescript. In addition it has commit lint and ava for testing. So not so vanilla. More of a minimal preset. You get to chose your preferred front end framework. Enjoy making things.

## Install
```
npm install
```

## Build project
```
npm run build
```
look for the dist folder that is generated

## Test
```
npm run test
```
supports naming convention: moduleName.test.ts
